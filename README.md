# DAPNET Legacy Transmitter Service
This service is responsible for providing a backwards compatibility layer to legacy DAPNET v1 transmitters. Note that only features supported by the legacy DAPNET protocol are available. If possible, transmitters should be updated to the new DAPNET protocol/archictecture for optimal support.
